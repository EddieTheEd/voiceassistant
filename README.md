# Voice Assistant

Hello!

You're probably reading this because I asked you to do the survey. Here's a guide on how to install the necessary modules:

1. Install pip (google this)
2. Navigate to the folder of this program through command prompt (cd)
3. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4. Open the entire program in a code editor (preferably Visual Studio Code)
  4a. Ensure you can run Python on this code editor
5. Run the python file "voiceassistant.py"


Thanks, 
Ed :)
